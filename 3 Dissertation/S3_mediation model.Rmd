![ ](MediationModel.jpg)

Approach:   
- Model 1 estimates *c* path (total effect), Model 2 estimates *a* path, Model 3 estimates *b* and *c'* path  
- Indirect effect calculated by multiplying *ab*  
- Asymmetric confidence limits approach used to calculate confidence interval estimate of indirect effect  
- Done separately for each task

Calculate confidence interval of estimate of indirect effect
</span>

First, calculate Sobel standard error:

<center>
$\sigma_{ab} = \sqrt{a^2\sigma_{b}^2 + b^2\sigma_{a}^2}$,   
where $\sigma_{a}$ and $\sigma_{b}$ are the standard errors of paths *a* and *b*.
</center>
<br>

Then, use the asymmetric confidence limits approach with the empirical-M critical values to get 95% CIs:

<center>
*Upper Limit* = *ab* + *(C.V. Upper)*($\sigma_{ab}$)  

*Lower Limit* = *ab* + *(C.V. Lower)*($\sigma_{ab}$)
</center>
<br>
The confidence intervals are calculated in RMediation using the empirical-M approach (also called distribution of products approach).

```{r}
CIs.between = medci(a.between, b.between, a.se.between, b.se.between, type="dop")
CIs.between.lower = round(CIs.between$`97.5% CI`[1], digits=3)
CIs.between.upper = round(CIs.between$`97.5% CI`[2], digits=3)
CIs.within = medci(a.within, b.within, a.se.within, b.se.within, type="MC")
CIs.within.lower = round(CIs.within$`97.5% CI`[1], digits=3)
CIs.within.upper = round(CIs.within$`97.5% CI`[2], digits=3)
```
